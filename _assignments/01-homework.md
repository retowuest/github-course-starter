# Instructions

Each student will write two critical response papers over the course of the semester. Each paper will not exceed 1,000 words including tables, references, captions, footnotes, and endnotes. A paper must be turned in within two weeks of the discussion of the reading it responds to. For example, if a response paper addresses a reading discussed on March 17 (respectively, March 18), the latest it can be turned in is March 31 (respectively, April 1).

**Important:** Late papers will not be accepted (and thus will receive a grade of zero) unless you have documentation of a medical or family emergency.

A critical response paper has two goals: to summarize the main idea of a course reading and to provide a critical assessment of the reading it is responding to. A response paper should include the following elements:

* Introduction

* Body

* Conclusion
