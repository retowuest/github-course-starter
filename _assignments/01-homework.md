# Instructions

Students will write two critical response papers over the course of the semester. Each paper will not exceed 1,000 words including tables, references, captions, footnotes, and endnotes. The papers must be turned in within two weeks of the discussion of the reading they respond to. For example, if a response paper addresses a reading that is discussed on March 17 (respectively, March 18), the latest it can be turned in is March 31 (respectively, April 1).

**Important:** Late papers will not be accepted (and thus will receive a grade of zero) unless you have documentation of a medical or family emergency.
