# Instructions

Each student will write two critical response papers over the course of the semester. Each paper will not exceed 1,000 words including tables, references, captions, footnotes, and endnotes. A paper must be turned in within two weeks of the discussion of the reading it responds to. For example, if a response paper addresses a reading discussed on March 17 (respectively, March 18), the latest it can be turned in is March 31 (respectively, April 1).

**Important:** Late papers will not be accepted (and thus will receive a grade of zero) unless you have documentation of a medical or family emergency.

A critical response paper has two goals: to summarize the main idea of a course reading and to provide a critical assessment. A response paper should include the following elements:

* Introduction: The introduction provides information on the author and publication you are responding to and a brief summary of the main points, ideas, or arguments of the work.

* Body: The body contains the arguments the response paper makes. Here are some examples of the kind of arguments a critical response paper might make (this is not an exhaustive list).

  * For theoretical readings:

  * For empirical readings:

* Conclusion
