# Instructions

Each student will give a presentation in class on one of the required readings listed in the syllabus. We will make the presentation schedule in the second week of class. Take some time before then to figure out which topics and readings interest you most. You will probably find it convenient to write a critical response paper on the same reading that you present, though you are not required to do so.

Your presentation should be about 15 minutes long and answer the following questions:

* What is the central argument of the reading?

  * Try to summarize the paper in a single clear sentence.

  * What does the reading tell us about the causes of war that we would not have known otherwise?

* How is this argument supported? What evidence does the reading provide?

  * While the form of evidence varies across readings, most rely on statistical and/or formal models. You are not expected to present technical or mathematical material---just the substantive argument and the reasoning behind it.

* What are some counterpoints to the main argument? Do the authors address them?

  * Some authors explicitly consider competing explanations. Others do not. Either way, do not limit yourself to the objections raised in the paper.

* How does the paper connect to the other course readings? Does it enrich what we have read in class?

Your presentation will be graded on how clearly and deeply it answers the questions mentioned above.
