# Description

This seminar is an introduction to the analysis of international conflict and cooperation. The seminar begins with a review of the levels at which states interact and the primary theoretical paradigms in the field. It then addresses how states achieve cooperation in the face of international anarchy and how bargaining breakdowns, commitment and information problems can lead to conflict. We also explore psychological perspectives and the role of leaders, domestic politics, and international institutions in international cooperation and conflict.


# Resources

### Readings

There are two required readings each week. Students are expected to have read all required readings prior to class. The readings listed under "Further Readings" are not required, but they may be helpful for students who are interested in learning more about the topics. Links to all journal articles are available in the [syllabus](http://retowuest.github.io/j2p216/syllabus) on the course website. Scans of book chapters will be made available through [Chamilo](https://chamilo.unige.ch/).

### Piazza

We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/university_of_geneva/spring2016/j2p216/home) for class discussion. Piazza is a free online platform for class Q&A that replaces mailing lists. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post your questions on Piazza. This allows you to answer each other's questions and for the entire class to see the instructor's responses.
